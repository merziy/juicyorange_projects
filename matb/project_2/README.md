# Guessing Game component for Music and the Brain

I wrote a SFC with Vue3, Bootstrap, and Axios to get the application ready to request an image object. I also used Typescript for realtime type error checking.

## Notes

For Netlify demonstration purposes, I have the application set up to pull a random image from Unsplash. I have commented out three elements I wrote that gets some data from a sample .json in the public folder, so it should be ready to be coupled with the backend and request an image object; with a URL, a Title, and a Clue property in json.

To test this out, comment out the existing h3, img, and p elements, and comment in the dynamic ones :)
